        <p>As a new resident of Salt Lake City, I didn't want my life here to be like it was before I came. Now of course I miss things: certainly my friends, warm weather, favorite restaurants. But there was a lot I wanted to leave behind as well. I wanted to come here and be active again like when I lived in NYC. Soak in the art museums and natural beauty. Be outgoing and adventurous.</p>
        <p>My first foray into the art scene here in town led me to the Urban Arts Gallery for the monthly local artists connect event. I had only lived here for a few weeks and stumbled into the show, meeting amazing artists along the way. I promised myself that night that by next month's show I would have something to show. I felt odd about bringing an old piece or something I just snapped and edited on my phone. My submission: Reed near the Saltair Winter and Spring.</p>

        <p>The Saltair is a venue near the shore of the Great Salt Lake off I-80 about half an hour outside the city. While walking around the desolate area, I happened to catch from the corner of my eye this reed poking up from amongst the others. I did my best to get the reed in focus as it blew in the wind and not underexpose the image. What I captured was this raw photo.</p>

        <p>While unassuming, I knew I could pull something solid of it out. I mean it wasn't even lined up with the horizon. The editing process involved straightening the image, cropping it down to a good portrait, and correcting the light. The image is too flat due to the contrast between the highlights and shadows being too little. Increasing the contrast made the highlights brighter and the shadows darker.</p>
        <p>The initial edit yielded decent results for a nature/landscape shot, but to make this rise from the level of a good picture to art, it needed something more. I started with color grading, manipulating the light and color in the highlights, midtones, and shadows. I wanted to convey a winter feel, so I added more blue tones into the image. This cooled off the image, making it feel more like a winter scene. It was still missing something, however, so I added a snow overlay making it feel more alive.</p> 
        <p>Not wanting to limit the scope of this image's potential, I challenged myself to make it feel like spring had sprung. I brought more warmth into the image and added green into the blues, creating the feeling of life that exists in the second image. Notice the difference in the shadows behind the stem of the plant in the lower portion of the image. There are more orange and yellow tones in the spring image compared to the darker blues in the winter. These colors are what conveys the feeling of image.</p>
