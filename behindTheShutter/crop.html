        <p>Back in March 2022, I took a trip up to Alta Ski Resort in Little Cottonwood Canyon, Utah. I love driving through the canyons and the sights are just divine. I've talked about in a <a href="gapstow.html" style="text-decoration: underline;"> previous post</a>how when you take a shot that you need to include enough room in the frame so your subject looks great in various crops.</p>
        <p>One such beautiful mountain shot that I think woks very well with different crops is this shot of Mt Superior.</p>

    <div class="flex-container"><img src="../photos/mountains/snowmountain.JPG" width="600px"></div>
    <div class="aaText">
        <p>After a full edit of the piece, it turned into this full size finished product. However, a 5:4 landscape doesn't always work with where you are posting.</p>

    <div class="flex-container"><img src="../photos/homepage/snow.JPG" height="450px"></div>
    <div class="aaText">
        <p>Thus the 4:5 Instagram crop was born. It keeps the focus on the left side of the mountain face which is the most interesting part of the image, though the feeling has changed. Instead of the landscape that shows off the sheer size of the mountain which conveys a feeling epicness and awe, this tighter crop shows some of that size, but prioritizes a uniqueness in the ridgeline.</p>
    <div class="flex-container"><img src="../photos/mountains/tallsnow.jpg" height="400px"></div>
        <p>I also cropped a 9:16 wallpaper size that I think works well with highlighting the ridge side face of the mountain, however, this crop removes enough of the mountain that it looses its sense of awe at its size. The unfortunate reality with landscape photography is that the most popular photo sharing platforms force you into a vertical crop with increasingly more pressure for 9:16 instead of 4:5. This is one of the reasons I like to post my landscape crops here so that they can be viewed in their full intended medium.</p>
