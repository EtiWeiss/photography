        <p>Part of the reason I came to Utah was to see the most incredible places. I knew that on my Utah bucket list had to be Arches National Park. Here's the story about the edit of one of my favorite photos from my Arches adventure.</p>
        <p>I have this trick to exploring National Parks: Get there around 7pm, the lines to get in are non existent, the toll workers are gone for the day (self pay at the welcome center), and you pretty much have the park to yourself. Now I'm an avid car camper, so after a quick food stop in nearby Moab, I was ready for a night under the starsâ€¦ as seen through my moon roof. The best thing about National Parks it that they have campgrounds where you can just park and catch some ZZZs. Plus, once you wake up, you're the first one in the park and it literally is all to yourself.</p>
        <p>So after getting into the park later than I had planned, it was pitch black and I made my way to the far end of the park for some dinner and sleep. Up at 5 the next day, I was able to explore the park around sunrise without the traffic of the daily guests (this was Memorial Day Weekend too). Plus the early sun shined beautifully off the rocks. You can see all the highlights from <a href="../desert.html" style="text-decoration: underline;">Arches and Capital Reef National Parks here!</a></p>
        <p>One such photo I took was this shot of Turret Arch. Right away I knew the framing was great and the composition included everything I needed from the subject. The different layers of the clouds made for some great background dynamics, and the sky that showed through would look really cool once some color was added. I noticed immediately, however, that the image felt flat even though the rocks showed foreground and mid ground.</p>

        <p>I started with some basic light adjustments, upping the blacks and lowering white to create some contrast at the light extremes. This brings out some of the darker elements in the shadows allowing the image to have some spacial depth while softening some of the brighter features.</p>

        <div><h3>Basic light adjustments</h3></div>
    <div class="aaText">
        <p>From here, simple saturation and vibrance adjustments brought out the tone of the red rocks. Some texture, clarity, and dehazing adjustments brought the photo into the feel I was looking for.</p>

        <div><h3>Saturation adjustments</h3></div>
    <div class="aaText">
        <p>From there, some more advanced adjustments to the color mixing brought out the perfect rock tone. No color grading was needed on this, as the colors tended to be fine in their own light regions, just the overall use of red, orange, yellow, and blue needed global adjustments. I picked a color for the sky to contrast well with the color of the rock, and this piece was done with relatively basic adjustments and techniques.</p>
