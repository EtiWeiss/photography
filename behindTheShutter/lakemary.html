        <p>Summer was a great time for me this year. I got to go hiking and biking all the time and see absolutely incredible sights. With so much urbanization, however, the most beauty takes some effort to get to. With all the struggle, thankfully, I was able to capture some life changing photos.</p>
        <p>On a hike with some friends up at Brighton, Utah in Big Cottonwood Canyon, we did the Brighton Lakes loop. Starting early in the morning at the Brighton Ski Resort, we took in the easy stroll around Silver Lake before heading up the STEEP incline to Twin Lakes Reservoir. A few more undulations later we found ourselves at the sister lakes, Mary, Margaret, and Catherine. Ending our climb at Catherine Pass between Big and Little Cottonwood Canyon, we could see all the high points at the resort. A quick descent down the steep ski runs returned us to the resort just in time to avoid the lightning rolling in through the canyon. You can see all the photos from the adventure over at the Brighton Lakes Series.</p>
        <p>My favorite photo from the day came on the descent near the high point of Lake Mary.</p>

        <div><h3>Raw</h3></div>
    <div class="aaText">
        <p>As you can see from the raw shot above, it was a pretty ideal summer day, with green leaves on the trees, and beautiful clouds in the blue sky. I tried to capture an interesting framing of the lake with the trees on the edge and the stones in the background. I knew when I loaded the photo in Lightroom that the shot was good, but I really wanted to do something to wow the viewer. I knew brining in some blue to the sky would make the landscape pop, so I started off with a basic sky selection and color adjustment. Below you can see basic light and color adjustments on a similar image from the raw shot.

        <div><h3>Light and Color Correction</h3></div>
    <div class="aaText">
        <p>Obviously the biggest thing missing here is the water which shows the reflection of the sky is still reflecting the original sky, not the lighter blue I edited in. I put a few strokes of the correct color to see the difference. I also thought that the color of the leaves didn't work with the sky color, so I either needed to punch up the color around the lake or find a new color of blue. The blue just looked to perfect in my eyes, so off I went bringing more colors into the foreground. I added yellows and a little oranges into the leaves and grass to contrast the water better. I finished adding the correct color of blue to the water and changed some of the reds in the rocks to make them more resemble the original rocks.</p>
        <p>This is one of my favorite photos I've ever taken. A copy of it sits on my desk at work and a framed version of this sold the first night it was in a gallery. I was shocked when it sold and I've been chasing a photo as good as this for months. I think I've come close a few times, but none have replaced this one as the lock screen image on my phone.</p>
