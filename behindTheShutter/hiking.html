        <p>In Spring 2022, I was exploring an area in the Wasatch Mountains called Little Dell Reservoir at the intersection of Emigration, East, and Parleys Canyon outside of Salt Lake City. The road opens up to a beautiful view of Mt. Aire, and the snow brought in the most gorgeous highlights to the shot, however, the distance from the road to the peak was too much for the iPhone camera to get a crisp shot of. I ended up capturing a nice wide shot of the scene, but my white wale was just out of reach.</p>

        <p>I researched the area when I got home because of all of the no trespassing signs right off the road. Turns out, because the reservoir houses drinking water for the city and has a dam, the public is not allowed anywhere near the dam for safety reasons. You can go to the recreation area of the reservoir and kayak or fish, but no hiking around. An hour spent on  Google Earth later and I was able to find that a local high point I could see in my picture was outside of the no trespassing area, but there was no clear publicly accessible trail to get there. I found a trail that went a few miles from a golf course that worked its way around some hills before a very not maintained trail clearly meant for a 4x4 worked its way over some hills to a power station. From Google Earth I could see that the view would be a lot better and was worth the time investment to get there.</p>

        <p>In May, with the weather and my fitness better suited for this endeavor, I embarked from the trail head and made it all the way up to the spot. The wind shifted directions while I was hiking and by the time I got to the top, the clouds were blocking the sun over Mt. Aire, making it impossible to get a clean shot. I had to wait atop the hill across the canyon for the wind to push the clouds out of the way so more direct sunlight could hit the mountain.</p>

        <p>After about half an hour, the sun finally cascaded down on the subject, and I captured the raw image. I could tell the lighting was good and had a general idea where I wanted to take the edit. I started with standard lighting corrections and sharpness adjustments. For the creative edits, I felt that green would work well to tint the mountain, but decided to give a green sky a try. I loved the way the sky being darker juxtaposed the mountain. Even though I got way closer to the mountain, even more sharpening would distort the subject too much, so I softened the sky, sharpening the subject through juxtaposition. This created a really cool looking cloud form too, which I think turn this image into one of my favorites.</p>
