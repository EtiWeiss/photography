        <p>In a new exhibition that opened recently at the Art Institute of Chicago, pieces of the late 1800s Post-Impressionism are put on display, including rarely displayed works held in private collections. The exhibit depicts the changing landscapes of the Parisian suburban villages during the rise of industrialization. With these pieces highlighting the town of Asnières specifically and the Northwest suburbs more generally, the Avant-Garde aspect of the exhibition displays the changes to the artistic approach the Post-Impressionist movement pioneered.</p>

        <p>In 1888's <i>The Seine at La Grande Jatte</i>, Georges Seurat displays his revolutionary Pointillist technique of using dots of paint that are not blended together. This technique, much like modern printing, plays on the principles of Divisionism wherein the blending of the colors occurs in the mind of the viewer when observing the painting at a distance. In the scene, Seurat shows a person rowing a boat while a pair of small sail boats float down the river. This, combined with the uninhabited grassy island, shows a quiet, leisurely side to the Parisian town, a time sandwiched between the havoc of the French Revolution and World Wars.

        <p>In addition to being the highlight artist of the exhibit, Vincent van Gogh is the only non-French artist of the group displayed. A pioneer of the Post-Impressionist movement, the reclusive van Gogh took solace in the French countryside on the outskirts of Paris. With the theme of the changing landscape in both technique and history, the exhibition highlights van Gogh's Realism period that was less imaginative than his later works like A <i>Starry Night</i>. 1887's <i>Factories at Clichy</i> is a prime example of van Gogh's realistic approach to capturing the changing time in France. Contrasted with the rugged agriculture in the foreground featuring of the artist's style of elongated brushstrokes, the more reserved buildings of the town highlight both a change in the artist's attitude and the juxtaposition of industrialization against agrarianism.

        <p>The under appreciated French artist Charles Angrand was a maths teacher by trade who later befriended the Avant-Garde artists in Paris and co-founded the Société des Artistes Indépendants. His heavy Impressionist influence is on full display in 1889's <i>The Seine at Dawn</i>. The haziness of the morning sky is an easy target for the Impressionist ideal where the fog rising from the Seine distorts the images beyond. Angrand crafts a piece reminiscent of Impressionist forefather Claude Monet's 1872 work <i>Impression, Sunrise</i>, with the dark boat in the center contrasting with the early morning light cascading down on the river in blurred vision. What makes this piece standout in the Post-Impressionist school is the use of Pointillism, a technique pioneered by Angrand's friends Georges Seurat and Paul Signac. In the distance, towers of smokestacks can be seen on the horizon representative of the times to come. Modern viewers are able to draw connections here to Bob Dylan's 1964 song <i>The Times They Are a-Changin'</i> as the narrator warns of changes to come and to prepare for new ways of the world. This piece is on loan to the Art Institute of Chicago from the Musée Petit Palais in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>

    <div class="aaText">
        <p>Paul Signac is known for his defining style of Neo-Impressionism with the blending of Pointillism and Divisionism. By painting larger dots than his friend Georges Seurat, Signac layers his contrasting colors creating depth and shading in a style similar to traditional Impressionism. With the principles of Chromo-luminarism, wherein luminosity is created by the combining of color in the mind of the viewer, Signac's Divisionist painting created the maximum luminosity scientifically possible through color theory. In 1886's <i>The Junction at Bois-Colombes</i>, the artist depicts an evolving landscape of the Parisian suburb with a new railroad crossing allowing for more people to live outside of Paris and easily commute into the city. The advent of the modern suburban neighborhood came from advancements in commuting opportunities and cheaper land to spread out from the expensive, crowded, over-populated city centers. The influx of rail and housing changed these towns in the French countryside from farmland to a sprawling extension of the city itself.

        <p>By experimenting with laying out large swathes of bold color defined by dark edges, Cloisonnism creates an emphasis on individual figures within the scene. In 1887's <i>Iron Bridges at Asnières</i>, Emile Bernard creates the Parisian suburb's visual vocabulary as unique items, its bridges, embankments, factories, parks, and villages. Along with its sunlight, water, and brilliant natural color, this work, and others by Bernard, captures a unique framing of the neighborhood, one defined by the sum of all of its components. While others in the exhibit mesh and blend elements through a diversity of brushstroke techniques, this artist stands out for contextualizing the evolving landscape through a composition of individual items that each change on their own, and, when viewed from a distance, depict the changes in the larger society.

        <p>This exhibit features numerous other works by these five revolutionary artists that help tell a story about a changing society in France. The rapid developments due to the rise of Urbanization, the evolving economy into Industrialization, urban sprawl into suburbs, and a rise in “Modernism” formed a culture more apt to appreciate radical departures from traditional Realism. These artists in only a few years captured what it felt like to be there as changes in society swept through the outskirts of Paris. All of these artists deserve further study into their full length of work, but in the context of this exhibit, it is interesting that they spent considerable time in the suburbs to depict the encroaching juxtaposition of urban and rural life. These artists must have felt what Bob Dylan described with the winds of change blowing through Northern France.</p>

        <p>The exhibit is open now through September 4th, 2023.</p>
