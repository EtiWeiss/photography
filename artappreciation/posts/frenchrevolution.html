        <p>This oil sketch by Neoclassical artist Jacques-Louis David depicts the events of June 20, 1789, known as <i>The Tennis Court Oath</i>. Painted as a test before painting on a grand canvas in 1791, this piece memorializes the famed bonding of the Third Estate during the Estates General, one of the earliest events of the French Revolution. Due to ongoing fiscal and agricultural issues in France, a conference of the different classes in France was called in Versailles known as the Estates General, an event that hadn't occurred in nearly 200 years. When the Clergy, Nobility, and Commoners (the First, Second, and Third Estate, respectively) arrived at the French palace, the Third Estate was barred proper representation in the meeting hall. The Third Estate comprised 97% of the Kingdom of France at this time but were barely given a majority of seats in the Estates General. In response, the Third Estate formed the National Assembly to rival the other conference. Led by Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau, the famed Oath set forth the principles of the French Revolution that launched officially on July 14, 1789, with the storming of the Bastille. This piece is on display at the Musée Carnavalet in Paris, and the unfinished grand canvas is on view at the Palace of Versailles.</p>

        <p>Depicting the events of July 14, 1789, Jean-Baptiste Lallemand's <i>L'Arrestation du Gouverneur de la Bastille</i> from 1790 shows the early aftermath of the storming of the Bastille. After the Estates General failed to represent the interests of the people, the National Assembly was formed with Revolutionary ideas and took over as a governing body on July 9th. Civil unrest broke out in the weeks following the Tennis Court Oath, with revolutionaries taking to the streets in protest of King Louis XVI. Taking advise from the more conservative members of his Noble 'privy council', the King overhauled his ministry cabinet, notably finance minister Jacques Necker who was aligned with the Revolution. This was seen by the people as a monarchical coup attempt against the newly formed Assembly, causing Revolutionaries to become increasingly violent against royal institutions. After successfully storming other government offices, the revolutionaries turned to the Bastille, a medieval fortress in Paris that housed less than 10 prisoners at the time and a weapons cache that could limit the French Royal Guard from fighting. After a successful, yet costly, storming of the Bastille, 94 people died, almost entirely the revolutionaries. The governor of the Bastille, Bernard-René Jourdan de Launay, was arrested and dragged to his imminent death as shown in the lower right side of the painting. French citizens celebrate July 14th as an annual reminder of the Revolution. This piece is on display at the Musée de la Révolution française in Vizille, France.</p>

        <p>With France in chaos after the storming of the Bastille in 1789, the National Assembly struggled with the continuing economic conditions that preceded the revolution. Over the next three years, the new constitutional monarchy pushed through more changes but were hindered by the presence of King Louis XVI. After suspending the monarchy in 1792, strong European powers like Prussia and Austria sought to restore the monarchy resulting in a series of wars against France. In order to restore unity through a common enemy in the wars and quell political infighting at home, the newly minted French Republic instituted the Reign of Terror. Led by Maximilien Robespierre, the Committee of Public Safety became revolutionary enforcers, creating Stalin-esq mobs and executing over 16,000 French citizens opposed to the Jacobin ideals. A depiction of this can be seen in Pierre-Antoine Demachy's 1793 piece <i>Une exécution capitale</i>, place de la Révolution. The Reign of Terror came to an end with the guillotining of Robespierre himself in 1794. Louis XVI met his demise in the same way a year prior, effectively ending the idea of a monarchical reinstatement. Meanwhile, the French army had been rather victorious in its fight against Europe, with a rising military figure gaining political favor amongst the young officers: Napoleon Bonaparte.

        <p>After the end of the Reign of Terror, the more radical wing of the French Republic was replaced by moderates who later formed the French Directory in 1795. Further crises within the new French democracy led to coup attempts by Royalists, leading to further instability and calls for the reinstatement of the Monarchy under the now exiled Louis XVII. The French populace grew ever closer to the preference of 'uncertainties of authoritarian rule' compared to the 'ambiguities of parliamentary politics'. This culminated on November 9, 1799, with the Coup of 18 Brumaire which saw the downfall of French democracy. Rising to power was Napoleon Bonaparte and his French Consulate rulers. This lasted until 1804 when Napoleon declared himself Emperor and expanded French territory throughout Europe. Jacques-Louis David's 1807 piece <i>The Coronation of Napoleon</i> depicts the events held on December 2, 1804, at the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Napoleon's rise to power brought an end to the French Revolution and replaced one King with another a mere 15 years later. His own reign of terror on Europe through the Napoleonic Wars finally subsided in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo where Napoleon was defeated and exiled to island of Saint Helena. This propagandic, massive canvas created at the desire of the French Emperor hangs at The Louvre in Paris.</p>

        <p>The previous paintings have been in the Neoclassical style, a thematic device used by the artists during the French Revolution to highlight the importance of the contemporary political movement. Eugène Delacroix's 1830 piece <i>Liberty Leading the People</i>, however, is done in the Romantic style. After Napoleon's exploits and the restoration of the French Monarchy, the French democratic revolutionaries needed a way to restore the ideas of 'Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité'. Painted in the aftermath of the ensuing July Revolution of 1830, Delacroix depicts the final toppling of the French absolute monarchy with a lens of fondness for the first French Revolution. Through this piece, the artist wants to inspire the populace in the spirit of idealized comradery, while the Neoclassical artists before wanted to inspire action through grand historical comparisons. The personification of Liberty as a woman waving the tricolored flag creates a representation of France. With the spirit of freedom, the people can follow to a better, liberal future. The 1830 Revolution saw an end to the Bourbon Restoration of the French throne and the rise of democracy and liberal reforms that have continued to modern day France. This piece is on display at The Louvre in Paris.</p>
