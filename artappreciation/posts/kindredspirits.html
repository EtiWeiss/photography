    var text = '{"post":[{"title":"Kindred Spirits","artist":"Asher B. Durand","date":"1849","writeup":"A close friend of Thomas Cole, Asher Brown Durand was an early pioneer of the Hudson River School of landscape painting. Using less Mysticism and more Realism, Durand sought a true interpretation of the landscapes of the Upper Appalachians. He wrote as such in his series of publications, Letters on Landscape Paintings: "Let [the artist] scrupulously accept whatever [nature] presents him until he shall, in a degree, have become intimate with her infinity...never let him profane her sacredness by a willful departure from truth‚Äù. Durand laid forth in these writings the trajectory of the second generation of the Hudson River School. The occasional straying of pure Naturalism by Durand was grounded in homage to his mentor, Cole. In 1849\'s Kindred Spirits, the artist pays tribute to Thomas Cole, who passed away in 1848. Here, Durand imagines an idealistic scene of Cole showing friend and poet William Cullen Bryant the beauty of the Catskills. Originally painted as gift for Bryant, as denoted in the engraving in the tree on the left of the canvas, this piece is now on display at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas."}]}'
