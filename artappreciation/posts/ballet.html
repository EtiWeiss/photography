    var text = '{"post":[{"title":"The Ballet Class","artist":"Edgar Degas","date":"1874","writeup":"The Impressionist Movement was predicated on the idea of capturing fleeting moments. This ephemeral artistic endeavor involved quick brushstrokes that created a feeling of memory recollections. French painter Edgar Degas believed that dancers encapsulated this passing beauty in a live performance. He was especially captivated by ballerinas as their skirts created a motion blur reminiscent of the works of his contemporaries, like Claude Monet. In 1874\'s The Dance Class, Degas depicts a group of ballet students at the old Paris Opera being instructed by famous Ballet master Jules Perrot. The motion of the ballerinas is impressionistic, but the piece overall has a more Romanticized Realism reminiscent of one of Degas\'s influences Eugene Delacroix. Degas as an artist exists in a genre bending location with techniques similar to that of the Impressionists, Realists, and Romantics. These styles converge to make Degas a defining figure of 19th Century art. This piece is on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, and a similar piece from 1874, The Ballet Class, is on display at the Mus√©e d\'Orsay in Paris."}]}'
