        <p>It was my last semester of college and I finally had my major requirements on track for completion. 
            Needing a few more credits to graduate, I decided to actually take a class about the biggest passion I had while in college: filmmaking. I had made dozens of short films during this time on top of producing and editing dozens more. I was slightly surprised when the first assignment in the film course was to take a still photo. I understood later that the professor's goal was to teach us framing, lighting, balance, etc. My submission for this assignment: The Gapstow Bridge over The Pond in New York's Central Park.

        <div><h3>Raw Image</h3></div>
    <div class="blog">
        <p>This is the straight out of camera, no edits, raw HEIC iPhone 6S shot. While this certainly lacks the pop and artistic feel of the final product, the raw image lends itself to a successful post-production edit through pre-production set up. While on location, the most important tasks I follow to insure a smooth production process:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Identify a subject (The Bridge)</li>
            <li>Create a composition in frame (The water, reflection, and surround plant life)</li>
            <li>Frame the subject with room to crop on all sides (Center the subject, but do not fill the frame entirely)</li>
            <li>SURE YOUR SUBJECT IS IN FOCUS (Depth of field is targeted at the bridge, not the water, rocks, or trees)</li>
            <li>Adjust the exposure so the highlights and shadows are within range (Not too bright, not too dark)</li>
            <li>Prevent shaky camera with a tripod, gimbal rig, or any stand (I use a flexible tripod and remote shutter)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>On point 3, framing in camera this way allows you to create different aspect ratios without losing too much of the subject's framing elements. Too tight of a frame:  different aspect ratios will remove parts of your subject. Too wide of a frame: the resolution on the subject may be too low.</p>
        <p>My biggest recommendation for photography, videography, and filmmaking: Think like an editor. How will you or your editor work on this image? What aspect ratios will work with this current framing? Are the highlights overexposed? Are the shadows too hidden? The better you can make the initial capture, the less corrective work you will need to in post-production.</p>

        <div><h3>Black Point Adjustments</h3></div>
    <div class="blog">
    <p>For post-production, I start by airdropping all of the photos from the shoot from my iPhone to my iPad or laptop to use in Lightroom. I then do a rough edit on my phone using the default photos app to see if the light adjustments will work on the image. This shouldn't be an issue if the exposure was done correctly in camera. I also use this method to check my focus and framing for different aspect ratios. The only edit seen on this image is a black point adjustment in the default photos app.</p>

    <p>I notice that the iPhone tends to grey the darkest parts of the image and 100% black tends to appear grey and causes the image to look flat. Increasing the black point sets the darkest color in the image  closer to true 100% black which creates a wider range on the pure black to pure white scale. This creates more depth of blacks and whites that the image will use creating a less flat image. I notice this especially with the bright green tree on the right side of the image with the tree looking closer to camera. This is also present with the trees to the left of the bridge over the water.</p>
    
    <p>Comparing the simple edit to the final product, the most glaring difference you notice should be the presence of clouds above the bridge. The highlights (brightest parts of the image closest to 100% white) are too bright, and as such needed masking in that area to lower the highlight levels without effecting the highlights in other parts of the image. </p>
