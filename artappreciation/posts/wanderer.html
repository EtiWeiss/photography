    var text = '{"post":[{"title":"Wanderer Above The Sea Of Fog","artist":"Casper David Friedrich","date":"1818","writeup":"The Romantic Movement took inspiration from idealizing nature and pushing man\'s search for meaning into a spiritual realm. One of the hallmark pieces of Romantic art is Casper David Friedrich\'s 1818 masterpiece Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog. Depicting a well-dressed explorer standing atop a rock formation, this piece shows the subject overlooking what appears to be an ocean or fog high in the mountains. Representing this man\'s conquest over nature, his victory to climb to the highest point, and a completion of his spiritual quest, Friedrich romanticizes the end of this journey. What makes this piece stand out from earlier art styles is that the subject\'s back is facing the viewer. This is a classic example of the use of a RÃ¼ckenfigur, a stand in for the viewer that invites the us to imagine seeing the painting through the eyes of the subject. The idealism of the larger art and cultural Romantic movement from the late 1700s to 1850 is displayed here in the sublime mystery of the fog, the cinematic, dramatic portrayal of reaching the zenith of the mountain, and the unknown facial expression of the man. These characteristics allow the viewer to transpose their own thoughts and emotions to the scene and view them as if on a mountaintop. This piece can be seen in person at the Hamburger Kunsthall in Hamburg, Germany."}]}'
