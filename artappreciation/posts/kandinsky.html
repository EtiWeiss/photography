    var text = '{"post":[{"title":"Composition VI","artist":"Wassily Kandinsky","date":"1913","writeup":"Russian abstract master Wassily Kandinsky sought an artistic expression that would come close to the magic of symphony orchestral music. As one who experiences â€˜Synesthesia\', Kandinsky was able to see colors when hearing music. This pure abstraction of color that he experienced in the symphony is what inspired him in his quest for a painting form that captured that sensation. In 1913\'s Composition VI, Kandinsky evolves his style to achieve his goal set forth in his writing On the Spiritual in Art: to depict a harmony between two opposing forces in a purely abstract, non-representational form. Here, the artist uses his influence of music, especially Schoenberg, to create a composition of \'destruction\' and \'calm\' converging together through color manifestations of musical utterances. While not seeking a conscious, physical figuration, Kandinsky instead speaks to a more subconscious sensation. The musical visualization depicted here is designed to influence and create vibrations within the soul of the viewer, while also expanding upon the concept of time to show the melding of time into one singular moment. To see if Kandinsky achieved this goal of musical harmonization on canvas, you can see this piece on display at the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia."}]}'
