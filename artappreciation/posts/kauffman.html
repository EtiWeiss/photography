    var text = '{"post":[{"title":"Self-Portrait Hesitating Between The Arts Of Music And Painting","artist":"Angelica Kauffman","date":"1794","writeup":"Neoclassical artists Angelica Kauffman and Mary Moser were the only two female founders of the Royal Academy of Arts in London. Kauffman, a renowned portrait and landscape painter, is remembered most for her historical paintings. The Swiss artist worked throughout Europe depicting scenes from antiquity and portraits of prominent members of European society. Perhaps my favorite work of hers is 1794\'s Self-Portrait Hesitating Between the Arts of Music and Painting. Depicting three versions of herself, Kauffman shows the classic Devil and Angel on the shoulders motif. With her conscious dressed in white, a representation of purity of the undecided, the Painter version of herself argues with the Musician version, pulling herself in either direction. Whilst the Painter points at the Acropolis of Ancient Greece and the historical work she could do, the Musician, adorned in a Devilish red dress as well as flowers reminiscent of Mary Moser\'s paintings, sits below a column, representing the pillar of strength upon which her music career could reside. Ultimately, as we know, Kauffman chose the art of painting as her career, an achievement of self-determination that lasts as an inspiration for women around the world to carve their own path. This piece is on display at Nostell Priory, a historic estate in West Yorkshire, England."}]}'
